### Classes and Objects

* __Class:__ defines the attributes of objects (The blueprints to build a house). Each class is its own `.java` file
    * __Instance variables:__ each individual attribute of a class
    * __Methods:__ define the functionality of a class
* __Object:__ An instance of a class (An individual house)

    ###### Constructor

    A method that creates an object and sets the default values. Defined in the class.

    ###### Creating a Class:

    __Example__:

    For a "Person" class, the file would be named `Person.java`

    ```Java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private int age;
    }
    ```

    The class above has two private variables for a Person object. The instance variables are private to keep from being altered. Called encapsulation
